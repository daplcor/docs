Creating a Presale Token with TokenGo IDE
=========================================

Hello friends! Today we are going to generate the required smart contracts for a token presale with zero code using `TokenGo IDE <https://tokengo.fun>`_.

Overview of Token Presale
-------------------------
A token presale is an early fundraising event where projects sell their tokens to early investors before the public sale. These tokens are offered at a discounted price with benefits for early supporters.

In TokenGo IDE, we can create a token presale smart contract without writing any code.

Prerequisites for Generating a Presale Token
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Like creating a regular token, we need KDA or HERON to generate a presale token. In TokenGo, we will need 15 KDA to generate our presale token. First, we head to the `Kadena Faucet <https://tools.kadena.io/faucet/new>`_ and request 20 KDA on Chain 1.

Now that we have enough KDA to create our presale token, we can start generating it.

**Info:** If you are using our token generator for the first time, you will see a green button to initiate cross-chain transfer, and all chains except the one you have KDA on will be red. We discussed this in detail in our previous section on the token generator.

Creating the Presale Contract
=============================

In TokenGo, we are creating a token with the following details:

| **Module(token) name :** "sale-token" (you should give a unique module name here)
| **Symbol :** "SALE", (this will be our token identifier for this walkthrough)
| **Total supply :** 1 Billion (total supply of the generated token)
| **Image link :** URL for the token logo (this should be a link to your token logo hosted online)

After filling in the details for the token, click on "Show Advanced Options" and select "Pre-sales Contract". A form for inputting details of the token sale will appear. Hereâ€™s the breakdown of each option:

Filling Up the Presale Contract Form
------------------------------------
In TokenGo, we can set up our sales in two different phases: "phase-0" is the whitelisted sale, where whitelisted users can buy a limited amount of tokens at a discounted price, and "phase-1" is the public sale round, where any user with a wallet and KDA can buy any amount of available tokens.

**Total Batches for Sale :**
A batch is the unit of tokens in the presale. All calculations for phases 0 and 1 of the presale contract will be based on these batches. For our tutorial, we are going to sell a total of 100,000 batches, so we enter 100,000 here.

**Amount of Tokens Per Batch :**
This is the amount of tokens allocated per batch, the smallest unit for our presale. In this case, we set the amount per batch to 3000 tokens. Each batch will have 3000 tokens, so if any user buys a batch in the presale, they will receive 3000 SALE tokens.

**Pre-sales Amount (Auto-calculated) :**
This is the total amount of tokens that will be sold in the presale, auto-calculated by the system. In our case, it shows 300,000,000, which is 30% of our total supply, planned for sale during the presale period.

**Liquidity Account Amount :**
This is the amount of tokens allocated to the liquidity account. These tokens are not sold or held by the team but can be used to set liquidity pairs on a DEX after the presale ends. We are setting our liquidity token amount to 500,000,000, which is 50% of the total supply.

**Treasury Amount (Auto-calculated) :**
This is the amount of tokens allocated to the treasury, which can be used by the token creator for project development, marketing, or other purposes. This is auto-calculated by the system, and we see 200,000,000, meaning 20% of the total supply will be held by the treasury.

**Whitelist Reservations :**
This is the number of batches reserved for a whitelisted user in phase-0. We are setting our whitelist reservation to 100, so each whitelisted wallet can buy a maximum of 100 batches or (3000 x 100) = 300,000 tokens in phase 0.

**Phase 0 Whitelist Start Date and Time :**
This is the date and time for the phase-0 whitelist sale to start. We set it to 01/08/24 00:30 (it should be at least 12 hours after the token contract is generated).

**Phase 0 Price in KDA :**
 We set the price for 1 batch of tokens (3000 tokens in our case). We initially set the phase-0 whitelist sale price to 5 KDA per batch.

**Phase 1 Public Sale Start Date and Time :**
This is the date and time for the phase-1 public sale to start. We set it to 03/08/24 00:30.

**Phase 1 Price in KDA :**
We set the price for 1 batch of tokens (3000 tokens in our case). We set the phase-1 public sale price to 10 KDA per batch.

**End of Sales Date and Time :**
This is the date and time for the presale to end. We set it to 15/08/24 00:30. After this time, users cannot buy from the sales contract, and the token creator can distribute tokens and end the sale. after calling end sales unsold tokens will be transferred to the treasury.(we shall discuss it in later sections)

The supply chain is auto-selected as ecko, so we proceed with that.

After checking the details carefully, we submit our transaction to the blockchain by clicking "Generate Token - cost 15 KDA". This opens our wallet to sign the transaction.

Click "Confirm," and the transaction for creating our presale token will begin processing.

In a few moments, the transaction is confirmed, and all transactions are green, indicating that we have successfully generated our presale token.

Managing Our Newly Created Presale Token Contract
=================================================

To manage our newly created presale token, navigate to the IDE tab and click on "Select Contract" under the "Manage Smart Contract" menu in the right-hand side settings panel.

This opens a window to search for contracts, where we can see all deployed contracts, including our newly deployed contract, "sale-token." Select the sale token contract.

Updating the Prices(Before presale Starts)
------------------------------------------
If we want to update the price for a batch, we can do so before the phase-0 start time set during the creation of the presale token. Initially, we set 5 KDA and 10 KDA per batch for phase-0 and phase-1, respectively.

To update the price, click "Update Prices (before sale begins)."

   :align: center

This opens a modal displaying the currently set prices for phase-0 and phase-1. In our case, it shows 5 KDA and 10 KDA per batch.

We set our new batch price to 6 KDA per batch for phase-0 and 9 KDA per batch for phase-1 and click submit.

   :alt: Submit new Prices
   :align: center

After clicking, it shows the code to update the price in the IDE Pact viewer. We then submit and sign our transaction.

Our wallet prompts us to sign the transaction. Click "Confirm" in the eckoWallet.

After signing, we receive a transaction hash, and the transaction will eventually be confirmed by the blockchain if our data is valid.

Now, the new batch prices for phase-0 and phase-1 are successfully set. We just need to wait for the whitelist sale (phase-0) to start.

Whitelist Sales
----------------
A whitelist sale is a special type of presale where only whitelisted users can participate. For our sale-token, a whitelisted user can buy up to 100 batches of SALE tokens. To whitelist accounts, we need to call the whitelist user function, which will reserve 100 batches for each whitelisted wallet address.
