NFT Minter
==========

This guide outlines the process for minting an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) on our platform. Note that minting an NFT requires credits, which can be purchased on the marketplace. For more information on how credits work and how to purchase them, see :doc:`credits`.


Step 1: Select an Image
-----------------------

Begin by selecting an image you wish to mint as an NFT. The image size must not exceed 10MB.

.. note:: Ensure your image adheres to our content guidelines.

Step 4: Decide on Royalties
---------------------------

Decide if you want to add royalties to your NFT. Royalties allow you to earn a percentage of sales whenever your NFT is sold on the secondary market. You will also need to select who the NFT should be minted to, which defaults to the connected user's account.
